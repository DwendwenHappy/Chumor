# Chumor 1.0: A Truly Funny and Challenging Chinese Humor Understanding Dataset from Ruo Zhi Ba

## Introduction

Humor is an intrinsic human trait that touches the core of our social and emotional lives, making it a rich field of study across various disciplines. However, existing humor datasets and evaluations predominantly focus on English, lacking resources for culturally nuanced humor in non-English languages like Chinese. To address this gap, we present **Chumor 1.0**, a dataset sourced from Ruo Zhi Ba (RZB, 弱智吧), a Chinese Reddit-like platform dedicated to sharing intellectually challenging and culturally specific jokes.

We annotated explanations for each joke and evaluated human explanations against two state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4o and ERNIE Bot, through A/B testing by native Chinese speakers. Our evaluation shows that Chumor is challenging even for SOTA LLMs, and the human explanations for Chumor jokes are significantly better than explanations generated by the LLMs.

## Abstract

Existing humor datasets and evaluations predominantly focus on English, lacking resources for culturally nuanced humor in non-English languages like Chinese. To address this gap, we construct Chumor, a dataset sourced from Ruo Zhi Ba (RZB, 弱智吧), a Chinese Reddit-like platform dedicated to sharing intellectually challenging and culturally specific jokes. We annotate explanations for each joke and evaluate human explanations against two state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4o and ERNIE Bot, through A/B testing by native Chinese speakers. Our evaluation shows that Chumor is challenging even for SOTA LLMs, and the human explanations for Chumor jokes are significantly better than explanations generated by the LLMs. We release Chumor at https://github.com/dnaihao/Chumor-dataset.

## Dataset

The Chumor dataset includes jokes from RZB, with annotated explanations for each joke. The dataset is divided into:

- **Best Annual Threads (2018-2021):** Jokes selected by the forum moderator.
- **Moderator's Recommendation:** Highly recommended jokes by the moderator.

### Data Cleaning and Annotation

We manually cleaned and annotated the data to ensure high quality. The annotations include explanations for each joke, providing insights into the cultural and contextual factors contributing to its humor.

## Experiments

We evaluated two state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4o from OpenAI and ERNIE Bot from Baidu, using a zero-shot setting to explain the jokes. Native Chinese speakers then conducted an A/B testing to determine their preferences between human and LLM explanations.

## Results

Our evaluation shows that human explanations are significantly better than those generated by LLMs, with human explanations winning over 50% of the time. The evaluation highlighted the challenges LLMs face in understanding culturally nuanced humor.

## Error Analysis

We conducted a thorough error analysis, identifying common failure modes for LLMs, including:

- Cultural Unawareness
- Homophonic Humor
- Character-based Humor
- Insufficient Contextual Understanding
- Hallucinations
- Pun-based Humor
- Parsing Errors
- Cross-lingual Humor

## Usage

Researchers can use the Chumor dataset to evaluate and enhance the humor understanding capabilities of LLMs, especially in non-English languages. The dataset also provides valuable insights into the cultural and linguistic aspects of Chinese humor.
